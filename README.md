# docker_dublin_assets

These are the original Docker Dublin that were used for the [Meetup Group](https://www.meetup.com/Docker-Dublin/) and the [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/dockerdublin). 

They are a mashup of the Docker whale and a modernized representation
of one of the 'castles' from the [Dublin City coat of
arms](http://www.dublincity.ie/main-menu-your-council-lord-mayor-history/dublin-city-coat-arms)

The current operators of the Meetup and Twitter have chosen something else to use, but I preferred this design as more emblematic of the place and the event!
